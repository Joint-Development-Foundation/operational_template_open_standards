**[Documentation - Versioning](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#documentation)**

**[Software License Policy](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#software-license-policy)**

**[Working Group Chair Check List](./wg-chair-check-list.md)** as it name indicates, it contains a list of activities to be performed by the Working Group Chairs.

In addition to the [Rules of Engagement]() there are two documents that provide further procedures:

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`** 
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is a text file available in each `[Organization_Name]` repository. This file is created and approved by the corresponding `[Organization_Name]` Working Group. Its purpose is to describe how contribute to a particular repository. It can be adjusted as needed from one repository to another, even within the same Working Group. See an [example]() of a CONTRIBUTING.md file.

**`Release Planning`** 
It is a set of milestones that indicate what the group is planning to deliver and by when.
Each Working Group should create and maintain its own **Release Planning Document**. This document in its simplest form, is a table (a Release Roadmap), that contains version and release date. It can be extended with the list of features that will be released. See an [example]() of a **Release Planning table**.



**Members Benefits**
In the **[Rules of Engagement](./Rules_of_Engagement.md)** document, the section **[Membership Benefits](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#membership-benefits)** provides a detailed list of benefits for each Membership level.


**Working Group Charters**


**Work Packages**
A **[Work Package](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-packages)** describes the scope of the work and expected deliverables. It must be ratified by the **[Steering Committee](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#steering-committee)** and it is assigned to a Working Group.

**Technical Specifications Developement**
The section provides a high level process for developing Technical Specifications.

Once the **[Work Package](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-packages)** has been defined, the **[Development](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)** work starts. After the development work is completed, the group will initiate the **[Consistency Review](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)**, which is a process to formally evaluate the documentation prior final approval by the Working Group.
The **[Approval](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#omp-approval-process)** of the Specifications is performed by the Working Group after completing the **[Consistency Review](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)**.
Once the Group has formally approved the work under development, the deriverables need to be **[ratified](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)** by the **[Organization Team](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#organization-team)**. The **[ratification](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)** by the **[Technical Steering Committee](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#organization-team)** triggers the  **[Publication](./Rules_of_Engagement.md#work-flow-for-technical-specifications-development)** of the corresponding deliverables.
